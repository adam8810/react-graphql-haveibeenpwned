# Have I Been PWNed app

### Description
Uses an omnibar component to first search for an email address using the [haveibeenpwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) by way of a graphql (Apollo) api (See server/) and then allows for filtering by name and date as you type. This was inspired by Subreddit search on Reddit's web interface. Additionally the headers change the sort order when clicked.
